# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
myvar = "John1"
my_var = "John2"
_my_var = "John3"
myVar = "John4"
MYVAR = "John5"
myvar2 = "John6"

print(myvar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(MYVAR)
print(myvar2)

# Multi Words Variable Names
# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

# Camel Case
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariableName = "Pawan Kalyan"
print(myVariableName)
# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "Pawan Kalyan2"
print(MyVariableName)
# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character:
my_variable_name = "Pawan Kalyan3"
print(my_variable_name)
